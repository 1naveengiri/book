wpveda book
===========

**Status:** Just started. Far away from "ready to use".

Goal
======

Based on current status, it's better to list goals of this book

    1. Focus on WordPress themes and plugins development only.
    2. Must NOT contradict with [wordpress.org handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/)
    3. Use latest tools and technologies.
    4. Separate develop, document, testing, build and deployment clearly.
    5. Have opinionated workflow. Discuss every aspect and agree on "one-way" of doing themes but once a way is accepted, it should be the only way recommended by book.
    6. After book is ready to use, write some tools to review codes against books workflow.


Tools
======

    1. git for version control
    2. github/gitlab for code hosing, issue tracker and milestones.
    3. [wercker.com](wercker.com) for build and deployment. It can be used to deploy to wordpress.org SVN repo
    4.
