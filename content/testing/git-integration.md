# Testing & Git Intergation

TODO
1. Setup git local hooks so that whenever a developer commits code, tests will run.
2. If latest commits breaks any code, test-report will help isolate issue quickly and early

Notes:
1. `git commit` integration should be fast. So for functional tetsing - selenium is out. Cross-browser is also out.
